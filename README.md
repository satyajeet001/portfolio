# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, experience, and provides a contact form for communication. The frontend presents various sections including a banner introducing myself, a list of skills, a portfolio of projects, details about my experience, and a contact form for inquiries.
